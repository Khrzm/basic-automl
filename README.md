# basic-automl
Eucalyptus Growth Prediction Project

Overview

Explore and predict Eucalyptus growth using AutoML and ensemble methods. Utilizes the Eucalyptus dataset from OpenML and WEKA Dataset Collection by Bruce Bulloch.

Dataset

Primary data sourced from OpenML (Eucalyptus Dataset on OpenML), with additional exploration using datasets from Kaggle (Eucalyptus Dataset on Kaggle).

Key Features

    AutoML with AutoSklearn: Leverage AutoSklearn for automated model selection and optimization.
    Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features for model training.
    Ensemble Methods: Employ ensemble models for improved accuracy in predictions.
    Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using various metrics for insights.
